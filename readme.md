# README

This repository contains a Python script which can be used to modify a TrueStudio project to work on Linux.

This is done by modifying all include paths to use the Linux directory separator character `/`.

## Example Execution of script
```bash
$> ./transport.py -i sample/.cproject -o .cproject
```
